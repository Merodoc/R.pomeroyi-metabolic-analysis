Investigations into Metabolic pathways in Rugheria Pomeroyi

Rowan Elson-Green and Michael Gallagher

This repository is just a collection of tools to assist in the following tasks:

- collection of a list of known enzymes for DMSOR of XO metabolic pathways
- grouping of homologous enzymes for identity testing
- creation of profile HMMs for further investigation into similarity of proteins
- BLAST, local alignment, and HMMsearch of enzymes against R.pomeroyi
- Statistical analysis of results

These tools will likely be written with a combination of R and Python
